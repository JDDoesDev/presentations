I also like to start off by covering my ass
Disclaimer:

# Why are we here?
Today, that is<!-- .element: class="fragment large-p" -->

Note:
- Hopefully we aren't going to spark a philosophical debate that results in an existential crisis for someone.
- I'm here to talk WITH you about something very important to me, and hopefully to you
- I hope you're here because you want to take part in a conversation, or at least learn something
- Also here to tell story
    - Hope it helps someone the way another person's story helped me

<!--s-->

# But first...

Note:
- You're going to learn a lot about me
- I like to have an idea of who I'm talking with
- How many of you are developers, designers, or anything directly related to making sites or programming?
- How many of you are project managers, owners, or account managers or similar
- How many of you are in HR?
- How many of you are in upper management? Managers, Presidents, CEOs, etc.

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Major Depression

Note:
- Clinical Depression: feelings of low self-worth or guilt and a reduced ability to enjoy life.
    - symptoms that are present _every day_ for at _least 2 weeks_ - WebMD
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Anxiety Disorder

Note:
- Anxiety: characterized by feelings of worry or fear that are strong enough to interfere with daily activities - Mayo Clinic
    - Amygdala - lizard brain - fight || flight, feed || breed
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

Note:
- PTSD: failure to recover after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event - Mayo Clinic
    - Give the "RAM v HDD" metaphor
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

Note:
- ADHD: varying degrees of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention that lead to difficulty in academic, emotional, and social functioning.
    - When I was a kid, this was often looked at as being a bit odd or just needing to burn off some energy

<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

## I've only been getting treatment for a short time
(Relatively Speaking)

Note:
- Why do I mention this?  Well, remember when I said it's about to get personal?

## My Life Story
### The Abridged Version
Prologue

Note:
- All of this is hindsight and took a long time to come to terms with
- Some of this may be a bit difficult to hear
    - It's definitely difficult to say


<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#360101" -->

## My Life Story
### The Abridged Version
Childhood

Note:
- As a child I witnessed physical and verbal abuse
- Emotionally abused
    - This takes many different forms
    - As a kid I never had the words to explain how I felt
    - Made it difficult to make connections and handle my own emotions
- Different
    - I was born with a bit of a deformity
    - My right eye was crossed in (Example)
    - Surgery when I was very young, mostly cosmetic
    - Eye patch -- kids are mean -- didn't wear it
- Difficult
    - I wasn't able to adjust or pay attention in school
    - Bored easily, led to getting into trouble
    - Cried a lot, got called names
    - Overweight
    - Didn't have friends
    - Didn't feel like my home was a safe place
        - Lots of fights

## My Life Story
### The Abridged Version
Early Teens

Note:
- Still, not a lot of friends
    - 1 or 2 close friends who helped when things got rough
- I was considered an odd kid
- Parents didn't really care about my progress
- Disorganized
- Poor hygiene because I didn't have guidance
    - On one hand, I never got "the talk"
    - On the other, I learned to shave with scissors
- Left alone a lot
    - Had the bar number memorized (it's okay to laugh, it's funny now)

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#360101" -->

## My Life Story
### The Abridged Version
Late Teens

Note:
- Starting to feel like I had depression
    - Brushed off by counselors
    - Didn't feel that parents would care
