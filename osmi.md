## Dealing with mental illness
### Or: How I learned to dislike myself less

J.D. Flynn, Technical Architect

@JDDoesDev • Slack(s): Dorf

@TCDrupal • @OSMIHelp

Note:
- Welcome everyone!
- Thank you for having me

<!--s-->

# Hello!

Note:
I always like to start off with a big friendly greeting, so Hello!

<!--s-->

## Disclaimers:
* ### NOT a doctor<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* ### NOT a lawyer<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* ### Possible naughty language<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* ### It's about to get personal<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
I also like to start off by covering my ass

Disclaimer:
- I'm not a mental health professional
- I'm not a legal professional
- I also tend to swear without thinking about it... sorry
- Also, I'm going to go into quite a bit of detail

<!--s-->

# Why are we here?
## Today, that is<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- Hopefully we aren't going to spark a philosophical debate that results in an existential crisis for someone.
- I'm here to talk WITH you about something very important to me, and hopefully to you
- I hope you're here because you want to take part in a conversation, or at least learn something
- Also here to tell story
    - Hope it helps someone the way another person's story helped me

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#888f79" -->

# So let's have a conversation!
## You first <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
### DO THE FRAGMENT!
- You're going to learn a lot about me
- I like to have an idea of who I'm talking with
- How many of you are developers, designers, or anything directly related to making sites or programming?
- How many of you are project managers, owners, or account managers or similar
- How many of you are in HR?
- How many of you are in upper management? Managers, Presidents, CEOs, etc.

<!--s-->

## Who is this guy?
### OH YEAH, I HAVE MENTAL ILLNESSES<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- Drupal/PHP Developer for 6 years
- Doing HTML since the 90s
- BASIC around the same time
- MidCamp Organizer
- Drupal Chicago Meetup Organizer
- Paramedic/EMT/firefighter for 10 years

<!--s-->

## Why do I care?
<div class="replace">
 <p>_**I'm not weak; I'm sick**_ <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-out" --></p>
 <p>_**I'm not damaged; I have a disease**_ <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-out" --></p>
 <p>_**It's not a choice; It's a condition**_ <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-out" --></p>
</div>
Note:
- I suffered in silence
  - For a very long time I was in denial.  I was afraid that admitting I had an illness would make it real
- Perfect health until doctor tells you otherwise
- I worried that if I told people they'll treat me differently

fragment - Something that I often need to tell myself, and still have a hard time convincing myself of

<!--s-->

# WHAT IS MENTAL ILLNESS?

Note:
- Going to talk a lot about mental illness, otherwise this would be a very short presentation
- Mental illness refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior.
- DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) 5 -- latest version published in 2013
    - First one in 1952

<!--s-->

# WHAT IS THIS STIGMA YOU SPEAK OF?

Note:
- For centuries people with mental illnesses were treated as "less than"
- Stereotypes that people with mental illness are dangerous
- People weren't seen as people.  They were their disease
    - a schizophrenic compared to a person with schizophrenia
    - they're bipolar, not someone with bipolar
    - the mentally ill compared to someone with mental illness
- Led to people using mental illness as an insult
- Self-stigma - feeling that your disease defines you and that you're a burden
- Courtesy stigma - family members and loved ones feel shame and guilt for "contributing" to the illness

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

## Just what mental illnesses are you dealing with, you ask?
- Major Depression <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Anxiety Disorder <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- PTSD <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ADHD <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- TBD? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- Well, person I imagined just for this slide... I have:
- I'm one diagnosis away from Mental Illness Bingo
- I say TBD because there is such a high level of comorbidity, or co-existing conditions that I'm bound to collect another square soon
- Let's define these for clarity
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Major Depression

Note:
- Clinical Depression: feelings of low self-worth or guilt and a reduced ability to enjoy life.
    - symptoms that are present _every day_ for at _least 2 weeks_ - WebMD
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Anxiety Disorder
<img class="fragment brain" data-src="./img/amygdala.png" border="none">

Note:
- Anxiety: characterized by feelings of worry or fear that are strong enough to interfere with daily activities - Mayo Clinic
    - Amygdala - lizard brain - fight || flight, feed || breed
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

Note:
- PTSD: failure to recover after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event - Mayo Clinic
    - Give the "RAM v HDD" metaphor
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

Note:
- ADHD: varying degrees of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention that lead to difficulty in academic, emotional, and social functioning.
    - When I was a kid, this was often looked at as being a bit odd or just needing to burn off some energy
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

## I've only been getting treatment for a short time
(Relatively Speaking)

Note:
- Why do I mention this?  Well, remember when I said it's about to get personal?

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

## My normal was not normal

Note:
- For as long as I can remember, I felt this way
- Nature v Nurture debate
    - My childhood was rough
    - Witnessed physical and verbal abuse
    - I was emotionally abused
        - This can take many forms, and I went through most of them
    - I was left alone a lot
    - I had a hard time making connections
    - Few friends
    - Overweight, ugly, bad hygiene
    - Bullied... a lot
    - Didn't know how to handle emotions so I cried a lot or lashed out a lot.
- I thought it was all my fault.  I was defective.  I was unlikable.  I scared people away.
- I never had a sense of safety at home so I became afraid of everything
- I had one enemy in particular.  Ready to meet them?

<!--s-->

### Introducing: My nemesis
<div class="mirror-wrap">
  <img class="fragment mirror" data-src="./img/mirror.png" border="none">
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">You're worthless</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">You're ugly</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">Nobody likes you</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">I hate you</p>
</div>

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" data-autoslide="1500"-->

## Every. Single. Day.

<div class="mirror-wrap faded">
  <img class="fragment mirror" data-src="./img/mirror.png" border="none">
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">You're worthless</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">You're ugly</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">Nobody likes you</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">I hate you</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">You're WORTHLESS</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">You're UGLY</p>

  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">YOU'RE UGLY</p>

  <p class="fragment mirror-text larger bold">I HATE YOU</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text" data-autoslide="0"></p>
</div>

Note:
- I hated what I saw
- I couldn't understand how anyone could like me
- But it wasn't the mirror saying it, it was my reflection so it was me

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

## This was the norm for most of my life

Note:
- Sometimes I would try to fake confidence
    - It didn't work
- Sometimes I would act like things didn't bother me
    - They did
- Sometimes I would get angry
    - Okay, I was angry all the time
- Paranoid about everything
- Afraid of everything
- Deep, deep valleys
- Felt useless
- Unable to function
- I mess up everything I touch
- Unable to focus
- constantly in fear of losing my job because of reduced output due to depression
- spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was wrong with me

<!--s-->

## I wasn't allowed to have mental illness

Note:
- I was a paramedic in public service
    - We don't get sick, we help the sick
    - We're above having mental illness
    - I can name way too many people I worked with who died of suicide

<!--s-->

## Then something happened

Note:
Well, let me correct that...
<!--s-->

## Then some things happened

Note:
- I wish I could say it was a single moment, but it wasn't
- It was a series of events
    - College car story
    - Full blown panic attack, not the first, but one that I finally questioned

<!--s-->

## Career Change

Note:
- I got into development and I started hanging out in online developer communities
- Developer community is more inclusive and understanding than my previous life

<!--s-->

## Health Scare

Note:
- I found a lump where there shouldn't be a lump and I got scared
- Started re-evaluating a lot of things

<!--s-->

## I accepted I needed help

Note:
- The first thing was the hardest. I saw other people living happy lives and not going through the same things I was.
- People didn't get as angry as I did as easily as I did.
- People weren't affected by everyday things like I was and I had an epiphany that maybe everything else wasn't the issue. Maybe it was me?
    - if everywhere you go smells like dog crap, maybe you should look at your own shoes
- For a lot of people (including myself) this is the hardest part
- All the signs were there, but I couldn't see them

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

## Fear...

Note:
- Constantly afraid
- crippling fear of everyday things
- Social situations were paralyzing
- canceled plans a lot
- Paranoid about everything

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

## Led to Anger...

Note:
- I was not a happy person and anything could set me off
- Think of that lizard brain
    - Fight or flight, feed or breed
    - If I can't eat it or make babies with it, I'm going to run away or fight

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

## Led to Hate...

Note:
- This was usually a misunderstanding.
    - Okay, I did get angry and hateful sometimes
    - I once threw a couch in rage... not proudest moment, looking back

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

## Led to suffering

Note:
- I finally realized that I had been suffering and that there was something I could do about it

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/yoda.jpg" data-background-size="contain" style="margin-top: -10rem;" -->
## Sound familiar?

Note: A wise muppet once said...
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

# Finally, I GOT TREATMENT!

Note:
- I take medication
    - Better living through chemistry
- I see a therapist
- I find outlets
    - active in the community through teaching and in the drupal community
- I start the conversation

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

# But It wasn't easy

Note:
- There was a frustrating period between collecting my first diagnoses and getting medicated
- During this time I attended a talk by Ed Finkler
- This helped me realize something very important

<!--s-->

# WE'RE NOT ALONE

Note:
- Since getting diagnosed and erasing stigma from myself I've realized I'm not alone
    - Which means we're not alone
- Nobody is the only one going through this
    - May have different variables, but the interface is the same
- I realized that I was afraid because of the way people viewed me
- I don't feel that way anymore because of organizations like OSMI

<!--s-->

# How has treatment affected me?

Note:
- I'm not ashamed of who I am
    - Before, I wanted to hide in shame because of who I am and my conditions.  I've since realized that it's just part of me.  not too proud to admit i need help anymore
- The valleys aren't as deep
  - Not to say they aren't around anymore or that I don't have deep valleys, but they are much less frequent than before and more manageable.
- My anxiety has gone down, but still rears its ugly head occasionally
- Since getting on medication and seeing a therapist,
    - I've become more comfortable in social situations,
    - still introverted, so after this i'm going to need to hide for a little while
    - I don't have nearly as many anxiety attacks or times when I am unreasonably afraid of doing normal things

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/osmi_logo.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

# Now I work with OSMI

Note:
- Open Sourcing Mental Illness
- Focused on erasing the stigma around mental illness, specifically in the tech community
- Founded by Ed Finkler
- Run by some amazing people

<!--s-->

### Also, I can tolerate this thing a little more
<div class="mirror-wrap">
  <img class="fragment mirror" data-src="./img/mirror.png" border="none">
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">You're tolerable</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">I've seen worse</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text fade-in-then-out">Someone might want you around</p>
  <p class="fragment mirror-text--smaller fade-in-then-out">Even though we don't agree on everything, you have some valid opinions and shouldn't be afraid to share them occasionally</p>
</div>

<!--s-->

# We're not alone!

Note:
- I mean this in general, but more specifically in the tech community

<!--s-->

# WHY TECH SPECIFICALLY?

Note:
- Suspected for a long time
- Creatives appeared to be more prone to depression and anxiety
- Sites like now OSMI forums and word of mouth were all there were to go on
- Intelligent and creative people tend to think over situations more than others.
- Many people can "let go" of events or not look for cause/event connection
- Creative thinkers tend to re-play events over and over again to better understand them.
- Replaying can lead to feeling depressed or hopeless

<!--s-->

# IMPOSTER SYNDROME

Note:
- The feeling that you don't deserve to be doing what you're doing
- Give example of how you deal with it/are dealing with it.
    - Asking for help isn't weakness
    - Showing that you have limits
- Mention that it's common with people on FED discord
- inability to take compliments

<!--s-->

## More unexpected audience participation!
Note:
- I've been going on for a while now
- Let's change it up a bit and ask some more questions

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

## Would you tell someone with glasses or contacts to try looking harder?

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

## Would you ask someone in a wheelchair why they decided not to walk?

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

## Would you tell someone with diabetes or a heart condition to stop taking their medicine and to snap out of it?

Note:
Pretty silly, right?  Let's switch it up.
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

### Would you tell someone with ~~glasses or contacts~~ depression to try ~~looking harder~~ being happy?

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

### Would you ask someone in a ~~wheelchair~~ panic attack if they've considered trying harder to ~~walk~~ not have anxiety?

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

### Would you tell someone with ~~diabetes or a heart condition~~ ADHD to stop taking their medicine and to just try ~~being healthy~~ focusing?

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

### Images like this

<img class="meme" data-src="./img/bs-antidepressant.jpg" border="none">

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

### This...

<img class="meme" data-src="./img/pills.jpg" border="none">

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

### And this...

<img class="meme" data-src="./img/matrix.jpg" border="none">

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#675b53" -->

## They all pretty much say the same thing

Note:
They all say the same thing
- It's a decision to feel this way
- You don't need help
- It something you can will yourself out of
- Personally, I can vouch for the effects of medication
  - Everyone is different and what works for me may not work for the next person
  - Sure, there are a few side effects, but the benefits greatly outweigh the side effects

<!--s-->

### But remember...
<img class="meme" data-src="./img/neuro.jpg" border="none">

<!--s-->

## So how do we Erase the Stigma?

<!--s-->

## We need to be...

<!--s-->

# __STRONGER THAN FEAR__
<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/osmi_logo.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note:
- What does that mean?
    - Not "beat your fear at arm wrestling"
- Start the conversation
- Listen
- Let people know they matter
- Don't be ashamed
- If you have a mental illness, you're not damaged; you have a disease
- Be respectful
    - Not all disabilities are visible
    - Not all cuts bleed
    - Try to be respectful of what you say or how you portray diseases.
    - Sad != depressed, organized != OCD
        - OCD blueberry talk - Marissa Lyman
- If you do feel that you have a disease, get treatment!


<!--s-->

## Let's look at some stats

Note:
- Anecdotes are one thing, but facts help show i'm not full of shit
- We've done science!

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/osmi_logo.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

## Mental Health in Tech 2017 Survey Results
#### With a little help from 2016

[osmihelp.org/research](osmihelp.org/research)

Note: This survey was done by OSMI and had approximately 800 responses.  The survey was made available to several different communities.  All responses are self-reported.

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Would you bring up a _PHYSICAL_ health issue with a potential employer at an interview?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/PhysicalInterview.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note: Almost twice as many say "NO"
<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Would you bring up a _MENTAL_ health issue with a potential employer at an interview?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/MentalInterview.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note: Almost twice as many say "NO"
<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Do you feel that being identified as a person with a mental health issue would hurt your career? (2016)

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/HurtCareer.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:  Only 12% say "no".  That speaks volumes to me.
- This is something I worry about every time I give this talk, but it is kind of freeing knowing that all my cards are on the table

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" id="surveySlides" -->
Do you think discussing a PHYSICAL health issue with your employer would have negative consequences? (2016)

Note: Over 5x more think that there would _definitely_ be negative consequences

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/EverDiagnosed.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" -->

Note:
- This is self reported
- Average is around 20%
- 800 responses

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#888f79" -->

## What do these mean?

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#360101" -->

 ## We're afraid to talk about mental illness
 ## We're not alone <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" -->

 Note:
 Especially if we're the ones suffering from it
 FRAGMENT: It also means
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#360101" -->

## Why are we afraid?  It's because of the stigma.

<!--s-->

## We're afraid that being honest will have negative consequences

Note:
- We're afraid people will change their opinion of us
- Especially as someone with anxiety, worrying really can be scary
- Some of our minds go straight to the worst case scenario
- Mention email of "we need to talk" on 89th day of 90 day probation and "password incorrect" email error
- Binary mind

<!--s-->

## We're afraid we might get sent to the ~~principal's&nbsp;office~~ HR Department

Note:
- How many of you talk with HR on a regular basis
    - This could be a good or bad thing
<!--s-->

## As of 2015 _17.9%_ of _All_ U.S. Adults had some form of Mental Illness

Note:
"In 2015, there were an estimated 43.4 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States with any mental illness within the past year. This number represented 17.9% of all U.S. adults." - National Institute of Mental Health

- AMI - Any mental illness

<!--s-->

## Why should a workplace care?

Note:
- depression alone impacts an estimated 9.5 percent of the American adult population.
- estimated to cause 200 million lost work days each year
  -  costing employers up to $44 billion annually

<!--s-->

## But JD, What can we do?

Note:
Great question, slide!
Well, how do you eat an elephant?  One bite at a time.
- If a workplace creates a culture of inclusiveness, an employee may feel more comfortable being open
    - Do very little for days
    - Get angry that I couldn't function
    - Get afraid because I wasn't succeeding
- May have felt more comfortable saying "I need a day off"

<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

## *__43%__* of survey respondents claimed mental illness diagnoses

Note: So what does that mean?

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# We are not alone

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# We are more than usernames

Note:
Something that events like this help remind us of

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# We are real people

Note:
Look around.  We're not 1s and 0s.  We're actually here interacting

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# We are not damaged

Note: And with a little work, together we can....

<!--s-->

# Erase the stigma
