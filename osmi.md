# ABOUT ME

Note:
- Name
- Drupal/PHP Developer for 4 years
- Doing HTML since the 90s
- Paramedic for 10 years


<!--s-->

# ABOUT THIS SESSION

Note: There are a few things that I want to accomplish with this talk.

<!--s-->

## Open up the conversation about mental illness

Note: This is pretty important.  People don't want to talk about mental illness.

<!--s-->

## Share some resources and statistics

<!--s-->

## Share some experiences

Note: Both personal and professional

<!--s-->

## Try out public speaking

Note:  This should be focused on why you're doing this talk, not why you're talking about it
Also, take a first-time selfie

<!--s-->

# WHY TALK ABOUT THIS?

<!--s-->

## Paramedic for 10 years, EMT and firefighter before that

<!--s-->

## I've seen firsthand what untreated mental illness can do

Note:  Consider anecdotes from the ambulance, but nothing too drastic or depressing.
And because of the prevalence of mental illness

<!--s-->

## Burden of mental disorders is the _largest_ of all disorder categories in North America - WHO 2008

Note: But above all else...
<!--s-->

## **IT NEEDS TO BE TALKED ABOUT**

Note:  Mention Ed/Funkatron and OSMI, source for stat is WHO 2008

<!--s-->

# QUESTION TIME
(The fun part)

Note:  This is where you ask about
- developers, PMs, HR
- diabetes, HTN, flu, etc

<!--s-->

# How many of you are developers?

Note: Or themers, or site builders, or anything directly related to the tech

<!--s-->

# How many of you are project managers?

Note: or account managers or similar

<!--s-->

# How many of you are in HR?

<!--s-->

# How many of you are in upper management?

Note: Managers, Presidents, CEOs, etc.

<!--s-->

# Who here has taken a sick day?

<!--s-->

## Who has been afraid to call off for

Injuries? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Infections? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

A baseball game? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Note: Injuries - broken bones, etc.
Infections - Flu, cough, cold, etc.

<!--s-->

## Who thinks it would be alright to tell someone with glasses or contacts to try looking harder?

<!--s-->

## Who thinks it would be alright to tell someone in a wheelchair that they should just get over it and walk?

<!--s-->

## Who thinks it would be alright to tell someone with diabetes, high blood pressure, or a heart condition to stop taking their medicine?

<!--s-->

## Who would tell someone with a broken bone that a lot of people have it much worse?

Note:  This is what people with mental illness have to deal with a lot of the time

<!--s-->

## This is a fear that people with mental illness have to deal with

Note:  People are afraid that they'll be accused of being lazy or just not wanting to work

<!--s-->

## WHY SHOULD THIS BE IMPORTANT TO YOU?

<!--s-->

“In all regions, neuropsychiatric conditions are the most important causes of disability, accounting for around one third of Years Lost to Disability among adults aged 15 years and over”
(W.H.O. 2008)

Note: YLDs are calculated by multiplying the prevalence of a disorder by the short- or long-term loss of health associated with that disability

<!--s-->

# WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO ME?

<!--s-->

## I have mental illness

<!--s-->

## When I tell people, sometimes they treat me differently

Note: Sometimes they walk or back away, sometimes they start treating me more delicately.  No need to walk on eggshells around me.

<!--s-->

## _**I'm not defective; I have a disease**_

Note:
- This may be a time to mention difficulties at past job
- Definitely focus on it not being a personality quirk, but illness

<!--s-->

# TIME TO GET UNCOMFORTABLY PERSONAL

<!--s-->

## Major Depression

<!--s-->

## Anxiety

<!--s-->

## PTSD

Note:  You don't have to go into too much detail.

<!--s-->

## What are these?

<!--s-->

## Major Depression

Clinical _depression_ is marked by a _depressed mood most of the day_, sometimes particularly in the morning, and a _loss of interest_ in normal activities and relationships -- symptoms that are present _every day_ for at _least 2 weeks_ - WebMD

<!--s-->

## Anxiety Disorder

A mental health disorder characterized by feelings of _worry, anxiety, or fear_ that are strong enough to _interfere with_ one's _daily activities_ - Mayo Clinic

<!--s-->

## PTSD

A disorder characterized by _failure to recover_ after experiencing or witnessing _a terrifying event_ - Mayo Clinic

Note: Consider mentioning some ambulance things, firefighter things, and generalize childhood.  Give the "RAM v HDD" metaphor

<!--s-->

# WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE BEFORE I SOUGHT TREATMENT?

<!--s-->

## Difficult
Note: In a word, difficult.  Afraid to see a therapist because I thought that would make it real.

<!--s-->

## Deep, deep valleys

Note: But no high peaks indicative of bipolar.

<!--s-->

## Complete inability to focus

Note:  Also mention:
- crippling fear of everyday things
- constantly in fear of losing my job because of reduced output due to depression
- spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was wrong with me

<!--s-->

# HOW DO I COPE?

<!--s-->

## I take medication
Note: Better living through chemistry

<!--s-->

## I see a therapist
Note: I'm currently between therapists, but looking.  Turns out Indiana isn't full of reputable therapists

<!--s-->

## I find outlets

Note: Mention community band, becoming active in the community through teaching

<!--s-->

## I open the conversation

Note:  Mention not being shy about talking about it.
People don't need to know the details of your PTSD, but that you're not afraid to mention it in social situations.
If other people are uncomfortable about it, that's their problem.  Mention something about talking openly at events.

<!--s-->

# How has treatment affected me?

<!--s-->

## The valleys aren't as deep
Note: Not to say they aren't around anymore or that I don't have deep valleys, but they are much less frequent than before.

<!--s-->

## I'm not ashamed of who I am
Note: Before, I wanted to hide in shame because of who I am and my conditions.  I've since realized that it's just part of me.

<!--s-->
## My anxiety has gone down, but still rears its ugly head occasionally

Note: Since getting on medication and seeing a therapist, I've become more comfortable in social situations, although still introverted, and I don't have nearly as many anxiety attacks or times when I am unreasonably afraid of doing something that other people find normal

<!--s-->

# WHAT IS MENTAL ILLNESS?

Note: Now I've been going on for a while about how mental illness has affected me, but what is mental illness?

<!--s-->

Mental illness refers to a _wide range_ of _mental health_ conditions — disorders that affect _your mood, thinking and behavior_. Examples of mental illness include _depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors_. - Mayo Clinic

<!--s-->

# WHY IS MENTAL ILLNESS PREVALENT IN THE TECH COMMUNITY?
A few possible reasons:

<!--s-->

## IMPOSTER SYNDROME

The feeling that you're not good enough to be doing what you're doing

Note: Give example of how you deal with it/are dealing with it.  Mention that it's common with people on FED slack.

<!--s-->

## ISOLATION

We're often put on projects by ourselves, work remotely, or have little interaction with coworkers

Note: Developers, at least the ones I've dealt with, are a certain kind of people.  Sometimes we don't always relate to others the way that we see them relating to each other.  Mention how remote work, although it allows flexibility, can cause feelings of isolation.
<!--s-->

## PERFECTIONISTS

Usually, we don't like to put out crap code. We prefer things to be perfect, but...

<!--s-->

## WORK NEVER ENDS

We have job security, but there are always bugs, feature requests, or any number of issues that keep projects from ever being complete.

Note:  By the time you get to a point where you think you're done and your issue queue is empty, it's time for a reskin or rebuild.  For those of us who are completionists, this can be really stressful

<!--s-->

# SEVERE LACK OF RESEARCH

Note:  Although it was suspected that there was a higher incidence of mental illness in the tech community, there was no specific tech community research done.  Sites like devpression.com and word of mouth were all there were to go on

<!--s-->

## FORTUNATELY, we don't have to rely on speculation anymore... The research has been done!

Note: And is still being done

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/osmi_logo.png" data-background-size="contain" -->
# OSMI

Note:  Here's a great place to talk about OSMI, what they (we) do, and some of the research done through surveys.

## Mental Health in Tech 2016 Survey Results

As of 11/16/2016, US Residents, Non-self-employed

[osmihelp.org/research](osmihelp.org/research)

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Would you bring up a health issue with a potential employer at an interview?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/interview_chart.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note: Almost twice as many say "NO"
<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Does your employer provide resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/resources_chart.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note: Only 30% can say with any certainty that they know there are resources, but the highest percentage says no.

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Do you feel that being identified as a person with a mental health issue would hurt your career?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/identified_chart.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:  Only 12% say "no".  That speaks volumes to me.

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" id="surveySlides" -->
Do you think discussing a health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/employer_chart.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note: Over 5x more think that there would _definitely_ be negative consequences

<!--v-->

[back](#/backSlide)

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/diagnosed_chart.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:  
- This is self reported
- Average is 20%
- 1500 responses


<!--s-->

## What's the recurring theme here?

# We're afraid to talk about it
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!--s-->

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/y_tho.jpg" border="none">

Note: what would a deck be without a meme?

<!--s-->

## Why are we afraid?  It's because of the stigma.

<!--s-->

## What if people with physical health problems were treated the way people with mental health problems were treated?

<!--s-->

## So how do we Erase the Stigma?

<!--s-->

## We need to be...

<!--s-->

# __STRONGER THAN FEAR__
<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/osmi_logo.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!--s-->

# Open the conversation

<!--s-->

# Listen

Note: If someone trusts you enough to talk about their mental health, listen.  

<!--s-->

# Let people know they matter

Note: As someone with a disability, hearing an affirmation can do amazing things

<!--s-->

# Don't be ashamed

Note: If you have a mental illness, you're not damaged; you have a disease

<!--s-->

# Be respectful

Note: You can't always tell who has a disability.  Try to be respectful of what you say or how you portray diseases.

If you do feel that you have a disease, get treatment!

<!--s-->

## This is all good for personal relationships, but what about the workplace?

Remember when we talked about it [here](#/surveySlides)?

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: id="backSlide" -->
## We're afraid that being honest will have negative consequences

For many of us, this means suffering in silence

Note:  Possible anecdote about recent situation at old job.

<!--s-->

## We're afraid coworkers will change their opinion of us

Note: Especially as someone with anxiety, worrying what people think can drive you mad

<!--s-->

## We're afraid we might get sent to the ~~principal's&nbsp;office~~ HR Department

Note: Mention how it took you a lot to build up the courage to tell your bosses about your illness only to get a call from HR.  From people you deal with every day to someone who might as well be a stranger.

<!--s-->

## Why should a workplace care?

<!--s-->

## Ignorance kills productivity

## Reduced productivity kills the bottom line

Note:
- This goes both ways.  
- Before treatment I would have stretches where I didn't accomplish anything
- That would lead to anxiety about not getting anything done
- Job insecurity
- Management didn't know how to handle
- HR didn't want to hear

<!--s-->

# Fight ignorance with information

Note: mention the exit interview and sending a link to OSMI

<!--s-->

## Get the OSMI handbooks

# http://bit.ly/osmi-books <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<!--s-->

## The tech community is our greatest resource

Note:
Time to bring it home --
Especially in open source communities

<!--s-->

## *__50%__* of survey respondents claimed mental illness diagnoses

Note: So what does that mean?

<!--s-->

# We are not alone

<!--s-->

# We are more than usernames

<!--s-->

# We are real people

<!--s-->

# We are not damaged

<!--s-->

# We are stronger than fear
