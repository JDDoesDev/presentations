# ABOUT THIS SESSION

- Open up the conversation about mental illness
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Share some resources and statistics
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Share some experiences
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Try out public speaking
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:  This should be focused on why you're doing this talk, not why you're talking about it
Also, take a first-time selfie

<!--s-->

## WHY TALK ABOUT THIS?

- Paramedic for 10 years, EMT before that
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

- I've seen firsthand what untreated mental illness can do
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Note:  Consider anecdotes from the ambulance, but nothing too drastic or depressing.  

<!--s-->

## WHY TALK ABOUT THIS? (cont.)

- Burden of mental disorders is the largest of all disorder categories in North America - WHO 2008
<!-- .element: class="fragment"  -->

- **IT NEEDS TO BE TALKED ABOUT**
<!-- .element: class="fragment important"  -->

Note:  Mention Ed/Funkatron and OSMI, source for stat is WHO 2008

<!--s-->

# QUESTION TIME
(The fun part)

Note:  This is where you ask about
- developers, PMs, HR
- diabetes, HTN, flu, etc

<!--s-->

# How many of you are developers?

Note: Or themers, or site builders, or anything directly related to the tech

<!--s-->

# How many of you are project managers?

Note: or account managers or similar

<!--s-->

# How many of you are in HR?

<!--s-->

# How many of you are in upper management?

Note: Managers, Presidents, CEOs, etc.

<!--s-->

# Who here has taken a sick day?

<!--s-->

## Who has been afraid to call off for

- Bronchitis? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Strep throat? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The Flu? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!--s-->

## Who thinks it would be alright to tell someone with glasses or contacts to try harder?

<!--s-->

## Who thinks it would be alright to tell someone in a wheelchair that they should just get over it and walk?

<!--s-->

## Who thinks it would be alright to tell someone with diabetes, high blood pressure, or a heart condition they don't need medicine?

<!--s-->

## Who would tell someone with a broken bone that a lot of people have it much worse?

Note:  Mention this is what people with mental illness have to deal with a lot of the time

<!--s-->

## This is a fear that people with mental illness have to deal with

Note:  People are afraid that they'll be accused of being lazy or just not wanting to work

<!--s-->


## WHY SHOULD THIS BE IMPORTANT TO YOU?

“In all regions, neuropsychiatric conditions are the most important causes of disability, accounting for around one third of Years Lost to Disability among adults aged 15 years and over”
(W.H.O. 2008)

Note: YLDs are calculated by multiplying the prevalence of a disorder by the short- or long-term loss of health associated with that disability

<!--s-->

## WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO ME?

- I have mental illness
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- When I tell people, the treat me differently
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- *I'm not defective; I have a disease*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- This may be a time to mention difficulties at past job
- Definitely focus on it not being a personality quirk, but illness

<!--s-->

### TIME TO GET UNCOMFORTABLY PERSONAL

- Major Depression
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Anxiety
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- PTSD
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:  You don't have to go into too much detail.

<!--s-->

## Major Depression

Clinical depression is marked by a depressed mood most of the day, sometimes particularly in the morning, and a loss of interest in normal activities and relationships -- symptoms that are present every day for at least 2 weeks - WebMD

<!--s-->

## Anxiety Disorder

A mental health disorder characterized by feelings of worry, anxiety, or fear that are strong enough to interfere with one's daily activities - Mayo Clinic

<!--s-->

## PTSD

A disorder characterized by failure to recover after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event - Mayo Clinic

Note: Consider mentioning some of the ambulance things, firefighter things, and generalize childhood.  Give the "RAM v HDD" metaphor

<!--s-->

## WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE BEFORE I SOUGHT TREATMENT?

- Difficult<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Deep, deep valleys<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Complete inability to focus<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:  
- Mention crippling fear of everyday things
- constantly in fear of losing my job because of reduced output due to depression
- spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was wrong with me

<!--s-->

## But it wasn't all bad

Occasional hyperfocusing <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: Although the hyperfocusing would sometimes be on useless stuff like WoW or reading meme threads until the end


<!--s-->

## HOW DO I COPE?

- I take medication
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

- I see a therapist
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

- I find outlets
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

- I open the conversation
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note:  Mention not being shy about talking about it.
People don't need to know the details of your PTSD, but that you're not afraid to mention it in social situations.
If other people are uncomfortable about it, that's their problem.  Mention something about talking openly at events.  For outlets, mention music and being active in the community.

<!--s-->

## How has treatment affected me?

- The valleys aren't as deep<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- I'm not ashamed of who I am<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- My anxiety has gone down, but still rears its ugly head occasionally<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: Since getting on medication and seeing a therapist, I've become more comfortable in social situations, although still introverted, and I don't have nearly as many anxiety attacks or times when I am unreasonably afraid of doing something that other people find normal

<!--s-->

# WHAT IS MENTAL ILLNESS?

Note: So I've been going on for a while about how mental illness has affected me, but what is mental illness?

<!--s-->

Mental illness refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors. - Mayo Clinic

<!--s-->

## WHY IS MENTAL ILLNESS PREVALENT IN THE TECH COMMUNITY?
A few possible reasons:
- Imposter Syndrome <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Isolation <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Perfectionists <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Work never ends <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note:
Cover each of these a bit more on the next slides

<!--s-->

## IMPOSTER SYNDROME

The feeling that you're not good enough to be doing what you're doing

Note: Without raising hands or anything, how many of you deal with imposter syndrome?

<!--s-->

## ISOLATION

We're often put on projects by ourselves, work remotely, or have issues relating to other coworkers

Note: Developers, at least the ones I've dealt with, are a certain kind of people.  Sometimes we don't always relate to others the way that we see them relating to each other
<!--s-->

## PERFECTIONISTS

Usually, we don't like to put out crap code. We prefer things to be perfect, but...

<!--s-->

## WORK NEVER ENDS

We have job security, but there are always bugs, feature requests, or any number of issues that keep projects from ever being complete.

Note:  By the time you get to a point where you think you're done and your issue queue is empty, it's time for a reskin or rebuild.  For those of us who are completionists, this can be really stressful

<!--s-->

## SEVERE LACK OF RESEARCH

Note:  Although it was suspected that there was a higher incidence of mental illness in the tech community, there was no specific tech community research done.  Sites like devpression.com and word of mouth were all there were to go on

<!--s-->

## FORTUNATELY, we don't have to rely on speculation anymore... The research has been done!

Note: And is still being done

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/osmi_logo.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note:  Here's a great place to talk about OSMI, what they (we) do, and some of the research done through surveys.

<!--s-->

## OSMI: OPEN SOURCING MENTAL ILLNESS

- Opening the conversation <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Providing resources <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Erasing the stigma <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  - TITLE TIE IN!!! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

## Mental Health in Tech 2016 Survey Results

As of 11/16/2016, US Residents, Non-self-employed

[osmihelp.org/research](osmihelp.org/research)

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Would you bring up a health issue with a potential employer at an interview?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/interview_chart.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note: Almost twice as many say "NO"
<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Does your employer provide resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/resources_chart.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note: Only 30% can say with any certainty that they know there are resources, but the highest percentage says no.

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Do you feel that being identified as a person with a mental health issue would hurt your career?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/identified_chart.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:  Only 12% say "no".  That speaks volumes to me.

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" id="surveySlides" -->
Do you think discussing a health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/employer_chart.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note: Over 5x more think that there would _definitely_ be negative consequences

<!--v-->

[back](#/backSlide)

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: class="chartSlide" -->
Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition?

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/diagnosed_chart.png" border="none"> <!-- .element: class="fragment chart" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:  
- This is self reported
- Average is 20%
- 1500 responses


<!--s-->

## What's the recurring theme here?

# We're afraid to talk about it
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!--s-->

<img class="chart" data-src="./img/y_tho.jpg" border="none">

Note: what would a deck be without a meme?

<!--s-->

## Why are we afraid?  It's because of the stigma.

<!--s-->

## What if people with physical health problems were treated the way people with mental health problems were treated?

<!--s-->

## So how do we Erase the Stigma?

<!--s-->

## We need to be...

<!--s-->

# __STRONGER THAN FEAR__
<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/osmi_logo.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!--s-->

# Open the conversation

<!--s-->

# Listen

Note: If someone trusts you enough to talk about their mental health, listen.  

<!--s-->

# Let people know they matter

Note: As someone with a disability, hearing an affirmation can do amazing things

<!--s-->

# Don't be ashamed

Note: If you have a mental illness, you're not damaged; you have a disease

<!--s-->

# Be respectful

Note: You can't always tell who has a disability.  Try to be respectful of what you say or how you portray diseases.

If you do feel that you have a disease, get treatment!

<!--s-->

## This is all good for personal relationships, but what about the workplace?

Remember when we talked about it [here](#/surveySlides)?

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: id="backSlide" -->
## We're afraid that being honest will have negative consequences

For many of us, this means suffering in silence

Note:  Possible anecdote about recent situation at old job.

<!--s-->

## We're afraid coworkers will change their opinion of us

Note: Especially as someone with anxiety, worrying what people think can drive you mad

<!--s-->

## We're afraid we might get sent to the ~~principal's&nbsp;office~~ HR Department

Note: Mention how it took you a lot to build up the courage to tell your bosses about your illness only to get a call from HR.  From people you deal with every day to someone who might as well be a stranger.

<!--s-->

## Why should a workplace care?

<!--s-->

## Ignorance kills productivity

## Reduced productivity kills the bottom line

Note:
- This goes both ways.  
- Before treatment I would have stretches where I didn't accomplish anything
- That would lead to anxiety about not getting anything done
- Job insecurity
- Management didn't know how to handle
- HR didn't want to hear

<!--s-->

# Fight ignorance with information

Note: mention the exit interview and sending a link to OSMI

<!--s-->

## Get the OSMI handbooks

# http://bit.ly/osmi-books <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<!--s-->

## The tech community is our greatest resource

Note:
Time to bring it home --
Especially in open source communities

<!--s-->

## *__50%__* of survey respondents claimed mental illness diagnoses

Note: So what does that mean?

<!--s-->

# We are not alone

<!--s-->

# We are more than usernames

<!--s-->

# We are real people

<!--s-->

# We are not damaged

<!--s-->

# We are stronger than fear
<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/osmi_logo.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

# Thank you for listening
