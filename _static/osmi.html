## WHY TALK ABOUT THIS?

<aside class="notes"><p>There are a few reasons I do this talk.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Start the conversation&quot;<ul>
<li>How many of you are comfortable talking about mental illness?</li>
<li>What do most people think of the mentally ill? They’re dangerous. They&#39;re unstable. They&#39;re weak.</li>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>As I mentioned, I have mental illness</li>

<li>For a very long time I was in denial.</li>
<li>Guilty of the stigma.</li>
<li>i thought mental illness meant someone was damaged or defective and i didn&#39;t want to be either</li>

<li>I worried that if I told people how i felt, they&#39;d leave me</li>
</ul>
<p>fragment - Something that I often need to tell myself.  Not defective or damaged, I have a disease.  It&#39;s a disorder, not a decision.</p>
