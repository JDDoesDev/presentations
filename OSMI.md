# WHAT IS MENTAL ILLNESS?

Note: So I've been going on for a while about hot mental illness has affected me, but what is mental illness?

<!--s-->

Mental illness refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors. - Mayo Clinic

<!--s-->

## WHY IS MENTAL ILLNESS PREVALENT IN THE TECH COMMUNITY?
A few possible reasons:
- Imposter Syndrome <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Isolation <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Perfectionists <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Work never ends <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note:
Cover each of these a bit more on the next slides

<!--s-->

## IMPOSTER SYNDROME

The feeling that you're not good enough to be doing what you're doing

<!--s-->

## ISOLATION

We're often put on projects by ourselves, work remotely, or have issues relating to other coworkers

<!--s-->

## PERFECTIONISTS

Usually, we don't like to put out crap code. We prefer things to be perfect, but...

<!--s-->

## WORK NEVER ENDS

We have job security, but there are always bugs, feature requests, or any number of issues that keep projects from ever being complete.

Note:  By the time you get to a point where you think you're done and your Trello board is empty, it's time for a reskin or rebuild.

<!--s-->

# FORTUNATELY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON MY THEORIES... THERE'S RESEARCH!

<!--s-->

<!-- .slide: data-background="./osmi_logo.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note:  Here's a great place to talk about OSMI, what they (we) do, and some of the research done through surveys.
