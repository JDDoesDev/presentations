<li>I start the conversation
Mention not being shy about talking about it.
People don&#39;t need to know the details of your PTSD, but that you&#39;re not afraid to mention it in social situations.
If other people are uncomfortable about it, that&#39;s their problem.  Mention something about talking openly at events.</li>

# WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE BEFORE I SOUGHT TREATMENT?

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Difficult

<aside class="notes"><p>In a word, difficult.  Afraid to see a therapist because I thought that would make it real.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Deep, deep valleys

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>I mess up everything I touch</li>

## Complete inability to focus

<ul>
<li>crippling fear of everyday things</li>

## Alone

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Feel alone in crowded spaces</li>

## I'm not ashamed of who I am

## My anxiety has gone down, but still rears its ugly head occasionally

<aside class="notes"><p>Since getting on medication and seeing a therapist, I&#39;ve become more comfortable in social situations, although still introverted, and I don&#39;t have nearly as many anxiety attacks or times when I am unreasonably afraid of doing something that other people find normal</p>

# WHAT IS MENTAL ILLNESS?

<aside class="notes"><p>Now I&#39;ve been going on for a while about how mental illness has affected me, but what is mental illness?</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Mental illness refers to a _wide range_ of _mental health_ conditions — disorders that affect _your mood, thinking and behavior_. Examples of mental illness include _depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors_. - Mayo Clinic

# SEVERE LACK OF RESEARCH

<aside class="notes"><p>Although it was suspected that there was a higher incidence of mental illness in the tech community, there was no specific tech community research done.  Sites like devpression.com and word of mouth were all there were to go on</p>

# WHY IS MENTAL ILLNESS PREVALENT IN THE TECH COMMUNITY?
A few possible reasons:

<aside class="notes"><p>These are my own theories and surveys.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## IMPOSTER SYNDROME

The feeling that you don't deserve to be doing what you're doing

<aside class="notes"><p>Give example of how you deal with it/are dealing with it.  Mention that it&#39;s common with people on FED slack.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## ISOLATION

We're often put on projects by ourselves, work remotely, or have little interaction with coworkers

<aside class="notes"><p>Developers, at least the ones I&#39;ve dealt with, are a certain kind of people.  Sometimes we don&#39;t always relate to others the way that we see them relating to each other.  Mention how remote work, although it allows flexibility, can cause feelings of isolation.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## PERFECTIONISTS

Usually, we don't like to put out crap code. We prefer things to be perfect, but...

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## WORK NEVER ENDS

We have job security, but there are always bugs, feature requests, or any number of issues that keep projects from ever being complete.

<aside class="notes"><p>By the time you get to a point where you think you&#39;re done and your issue queue is empty, it&#39;s time for a reskin or rebuild.  For those of us who are completionists, this can be really stressful</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Regardless of the cause, one thing remains the same

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

# We're afraid to talk about mental illness

## Why are we afraid?  It's because of the stigma.
