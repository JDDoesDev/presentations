## WHY SHOULD THIS BE IMPORTANT TO YOU?

“In all regions, neuropsychiatric conditions are the most important causes of disability, accounting for around one third of Years Lost to Disability among adults aged 15 years and over”
(W.H.O. 2008)

<aside class="notes"><p>YLDs are calculated by multiplying the prevalence of a disorder by the short- or long-term loss of health associated with that disability</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO ME?

- I have mental illness
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- When I tell people, the treat me differently
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- *I'm not defective; I have a disease*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>This may be a time to mention difficulties at past job</li>

### TIME TO GET UNCOMFORTABLY PERSONAL

<aside class="notes"><p>You don&#39;t have to go into too much detail.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Major Depression

Clinical depression is marked by a depressed mood most of the day, sometimes particularly in the morning, and a loss of interest in normal activities and relationships -- symptoms that are present every day for at least 2 weeks - WebMD

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Anxiety Disorder

A mental health disorder characterized by feelings of worry, anxiety, or fear that are strong enough to interfere with one's daily activities - Mayo Clinic

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## PTSD

A disorder characterized by failure to recover after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event - Mayo Clinic

<aside class="notes"><p>Consider mentioning some of the ambulance things, firefighter things, and generalize childhood.  Give the &quot;RAM v HDD&quot; metaphor</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE BEFORE I SOUGHT TREATMENT?

- Difficult<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Deep, deep valleys<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Complete inability to focus<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Mention crippling fear of everyday things</li>
<li>constantly in fear of losing my job because of reduced output due to depression</li>
<li>spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was wrong with me</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## But it wasn't all bad

Occasional hyperfocusing <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>Although the hyperfocusing would sometimes be on useless stuff like WoW or reading meme threads until the end</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## HOW DO I COPE?

- I take medication
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

- I see a therapist
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

- I find outlets
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

- I open the conversation
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>Mention not being shy about talking about it.
People don&#39;t need to know the details of your PTSD, but that you&#39;re not afraid to mention it in social situations.
If other people are uncomfortable about it, that&#39;s their problem.  Mention something about talking openly at events.  For outlets, mention music and being active in the community.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## How has treatment affected me?

- The valleys aren't as deep<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- I'm not ashamed of who I am<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- My anxiety has gone down, but still rears its ugly head occasionally<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>Since getting on medication and seeing a therapist, I&#39;ve become more comfortable in social situations, although still introverted, and I don&#39;t have nearly as many anxiety attacks or times when I am unreasonably afraid of doing something that other people find normal</p>

# WHAT IS MENTAL ILLNESS?

<aside class="notes"><p>So I&#39;ve been going on for a while about how mental illness has affected me, but what is mental illness?</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Mental illness refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors. - Mayo Clinic

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## WHY IS MENTAL ILLNESS PREVALENT IN THE TECH COMMUNITY?
A few possible reasons:
- Imposter Syndrome <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Isolation <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Perfectionists <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Work never ends <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>Cover each of these a bit more on the next slides</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## IMPOSTER SYNDROME

The feeling that you're not good enough to be doing what you're doing

<aside class="notes"><p>Without raising hands or anything, how many of you deal with imposter syndrome?</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## ISOLATION

We're often put on projects by ourselves, work remotely, or have issues relating to other coworkers

<aside class="notes"><p>Developers, at least the ones I&#39;ve dealt with, are a certain kind of people.  Sometimes we don&#39;t always relate to others the way that we see them relating to each other</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## PERFECTIONISTS

Usually, we don't like to put out crap code. We prefer things to be perfect, but...

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## WORK NEVER ENDS

We have job security, but there are always bugs, feature requests, or any number of issues that keep projects from ever being complete.

<aside class="notes"><p>By the time you get to a point where you think you&#39;re done and your issue queue is empty, it&#39;s time for a reskin or rebuild.  For those of us who are completionists, this can be really stressful</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## SEVERE LACK OF RESEARCH

<aside class="notes"><p>Although it was suspected that there was a higher incidence of mental illness in the tech community, there was no specific tech community research done.  Sites like devpression.com and word of mouth were all there were to go on</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## FORTUNATELY, we don't have to rely on speculation anymore... The research has been done!

<aside class="notes"><p>And is still being done</p>
