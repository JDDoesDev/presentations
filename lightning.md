## Disclaimers:
* ### NOT a doctor
* ### NOT a lawyer
* ### Possible naughty language

Note:
I also like to start off by covering my ass

Disclaimer:
- I'm not a mental health professional
- I'm not a legal professional
- I also tend to swear without thinking about it... sorry
- Also, I'm going to go into quite a bit of detail

# Why are we here?
## Today, that is

Note:
- Hopefully we aren't going to spark a philosophical debate that results in an existential crisis for someone.
- I'm here to talk WITH you about something very important to me, and hopefully to you
- I hope you're here because you want to take part in a conversation, or at least learn something
- Also here to tell story
    - Hope it helps someone the way another person's story helped me

## You first

Note:
### DO THE FRAGMENT!
- You're going to learn a lot about me
- I like to have an idea of who I'm talking with
- How many of you are developers, designers, or anything directly related to making sites or programming?
- How many of you are project managers, owners, or account managers or similar
- How many of you are in HR?
- How many of you are in upper management? Managers, Presidents, CEOs, etc.

## OH YEAH, I HAVE MENTAL ILLNESSES

<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Major Depression

Note:
- Clinical Depression: feelings of low self-worth or guilt and a reduced ability to enjoy life.
    - symptoms that are present _every day_ for at _least 2 weeks_ - WebMD
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Anxiety Disorder

Note:
- Anxiety: characterized by feelings of worry or fear that are strong enough to interfere with daily activities - Mayo Clinic
    - Amygdala - lizard brain - fight || flight, feed || breed
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

Note:
- PTSD: failure to recover after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event - Mayo Clinic
    - Give the "RAM v HDD" metaphor
<!--s-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#008e7f" -->

# Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

Note:
- ADHD: varying degrees of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention that lead to difficulty in academic, emotional, and social functioning.
    - When I was a kid, this was often looked at as being a bit odd or just needing to burn off some energy

## I Haven't had mental illness very long
### (On paper)

# How did I get here?

<!--s-->

# The dreaded STIGMA

## I accepted I needed help

Note:
- The first thing was the hardest. I saw other people living happy lives and not going through the same things I was.
- People didn't get as angry as I did as easily as I did.
- People weren't affected by everyday things like I was and I had an epiphany that maybe everything else wasn't the issue. Maybe it was me?
    - if everywhere you go smells like dog crap, maybe you should look at your own shoes
- For a lot of people (including myself) this is the hardest part
- All the signs were there, but I couldn't see them

# Finally, I GOT TREATMENT!

Note:
- I take medication
    - Better living through chemistry
- I see a therapist
- I find outlets
    - active in the community through teaching and in the drupal community
- I start the conversation

<!--s-->

# We're not alone!

Note:
- I mean this in general, but more specifically in the tech community

<!--s-->

## I was sick for a long time, but I refused to admit it

<!--s-->

## Now I'm stronger than fear, and you can be too

<!--s-->

## Let's talk more!
